# Can you buy the strategy? YES.

## 1. PKW (Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF)
*   **The Classic**: Tracks companies that reduced share count by 5% or more in the last 12 months.
*   **Pros**: Purest play on the "Buyback" factor.
*   **Cons**: Expensive fee (**0.64%**). Passive methodology (might buy a company that borrowed money to do buybacks).

## 2. SYLD (Cambria Shareholder Yield ETF)
*   **The "Smart" Upgrade**: Managed by quant Meb Faber.
*   **Strategy**: Ranks by **Shareholder Yield** (Dividends + Buybacks) AND **Debt Paydown**.
*   **Why it's better**: It includes "Debt Paydown" as a form of yield (Value). It filters for **Value** (P/E), avoiding expensive buybacks.
*   **Performance**: Historically very strong against S&P 500 Value.

## 3. SPYB (SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF)
*   **The Index**: Tracks the top 100 stocks in S&P 500 with highest buyback ratio.
*   **Cons**: Equal weighted. Often turnover is high.

## Recommendation
If you want to "set it and forget it", buy **SYLD**. It is the closest to a "Quant Smart Beta" approach.
